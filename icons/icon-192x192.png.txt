/* This is a placeholder for the PNG file.
   Since I can't directly create binary files, you should:
   
   1. Export the SVG we created to a 192x192 PNG file 
   2. Save it as 'icon-192x192.png' in the icons directory
   
   You can do this with tools like:
   - Inkscape (free, open-source)
   - GIMP (free, open-source)
   - Adobe Illustrator
   - Or online converters like https://svgtopng.com/
